        <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
        
       <p>cooking spray</p>
       <p>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch process)</p>
       <p>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
       <p>2 cups sugar</p>
       <p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
       <p>1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
       <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
       <p>3 large eggs, at room temperature</p>
       <p>3/4 cup vegetable oil</p>
       <p>1/2 cup sour cream</p>
       <p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>

       <p>RECIPE</p>
       <u>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper.</u>
<u>Whisk the cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl until combined.</u>
<u> Add the eggs, vegetable oil, sour cream and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute.</u>
<u>Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in a steady stream until just combined, then finish mixing with a rubber spatula.</u>
<u>(The batter will be thin.)</u>
<u>Divide the batter between the prepared pans and tap the pans against the counter to help the batter settle.</u>
<u>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.</u>
<u>Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely.</u>
<u>Remove the parchment.</u>
<u>Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</u>
